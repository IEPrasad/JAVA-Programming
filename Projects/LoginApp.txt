Instructions for Creating a User Login Interface and Login Application in Java:

    Objective: Create a simple Java-based login application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to enter a username and password and authenticate them.

    Tools Required:
        Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have the JDK installed.
        IDE: You can use Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any preferred text editor to write your Java code.
        Swing Library: Use Java Swing to create the GUI for the login interface.

    Basic Structure:
        GUI Components:
            A window (JFrame) for the login form.
            Two text fields for the username and password input.
            A button to submit the login information.
            Labels for username and password fields.
        Authentication Logic:
            Store predefined valid credentials (hardcoded or stored in a file/database).
            Compare user input with the stored credentials.

    Steps to Build:
        Create a Java class that extends JFrame to build the login interface.
        Add components like JLabel, JTextField, JPasswordField, and JButton for the login form.
        Create an action listener for the button to handle login logic.
        Implement the logic to verify the username and password input by the user.
        Display a success or failure message after validation.

    Error Handling:
        Display an error message if the username or password is incorrect.
        Clear the input fields after an incorrect attempt.

    Security Considerations:
        Never store passwords in plaintext (use hashed passwords for real-world apps).
        Use secure connections if connecting to a database.

    GUI Design:
        Position the components using a layout manager (e.g., FlowLayout, GridBagLayout).
        Make the login interface responsive and easy to use.
